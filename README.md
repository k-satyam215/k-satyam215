# Hi 👋 I'm Satyam Kumar

🎓 MCA (Computer Science) student at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna  
🤖 Generative AI / LLM Engineer specializing in Agentic AI systems, RAG pipelines, and LLM application development

---

## 🔍 About Me
I design and build production-style Generative AI systems, not just demos.

My work focuses on:
- Agentic AI systems with multi-step reasoning and orchestration using LangChain & LangGraph
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for document, knowledge, and enterprise intelligence
- End-to-end LLM application development using modern GenAI stacks
- Hands-on experience with LLM fine-tuning fundamentals (Supervised Fine-Tuning – SFT, LoRA-based adaptation)
- Prompt engineering, evaluation, and workflow optimization
- Internship- and project-driven learning with real-world GenAI use cases

Currently seeking entry-level / internship roles in:
Generative AI · LLM Engineering · AI/ML · Python-based AI Systems
